This town don't feel mine
I'm fast to get away, far
I dressed you in her clothes
Now drive me far away, away, away
It feels good to know you're mine
Now drive me far away, away, away
Far away I don't care where
Just far away I don't care where
Just far away I don't care where, just far away
And I don't care
Far away and I don't care where
Just far away and I don't care where
Just far away and I don't care where
Just far away I don't care
Far away and I don't care where
Just far away and I don't care where
Just far away I don't care
Just far away
Just far away, I don't care where
Just far away and I don't care where
Just far away and I don't care where
Just far away, away
Said, far away I don't care where, far away
I don't care just where, just far away
I don't care just where, far away.

The light in the window is a crack in the sky
A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye
A levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back
The man in the dark will bring another attack
Your momma told you that you're not supposed to talk to strangers
Look in the mirror, tell me, do you think you life's in danger, yeah?
No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)
(Tears, tears...)
Another day passes as the night closes in
The red light goes on to say it's time to begin
I see the man around the corner waiting, can he see me?
I close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here
No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)
It's just a sign of the times
Going forward in reverse
Still, he who laughs last
Is just a hand in the bush
So now that it's over, can we just say goodbye? (I'd like, I'd like)
I'd like to move on and make the most of the night
Maybe a kiss before I leave you this way
Your lips are so cold, I don't know what else to say
I never wanted it to end this way, my love, my darling
Believe me when I say to you in love, I think I'm falling here
No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)
Is just a hand in the bush.

I'm not like them, but I can pretend
The sun is gone, but I have a light
The day is done, but I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb
Or maybe just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
My heart is broke, but I have some glue
Help me inhale and mend it with you
We'll float around and hang out on clouds
Then we'll come down
And have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover
Skin the sun, fall asleep
Wish away, the soul is cheap
Lesson learned, wish me luck
Soothing burn, wake me up
I'm not like them, but I can pretend
The sun is gone, but I have a light
The day is done, but I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb
Or maybe just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb.
