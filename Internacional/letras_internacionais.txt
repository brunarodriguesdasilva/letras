All the pretty stars shine for you, my love
Am I the girl that you dream of?
All those little times you said that I'm your girl
You make me feel like your whole world
I'll wait for you, babe, that's all I do, babe
Don't come through, babe, you never do
Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
All those special times I spent with you, my love
They don't mean shit compared to all your drugs
But I don't really mind, I've got much more than that
Like my memories, I don't need that
I'll wait for you, babe, you don't come through, babe
You never do, babe, that's just what you do
Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
Don't say you need me when
You leave and you leave again
I'm stronger than all my men
Except for you
Don't say you need me if
You live last, you're leaving
I can't do it, I can't do it
But you do it best
'Cause I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
Pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
Pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry

The boy is mine, the boy is mine
The boy is mine, the boy is mine
The boy is mine
Excuse me can I please talk to you for a minute?
Uh huh sure, you know you look kinda familiar
Yeah you do to, but I just wanted to know do you know somebody named?
You know his name
Oh yeah definitely I know his name
Well I just want to let you that he's mine
Huh no, no he's mine
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine
Think it's time we got this straight
Sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man, are you insane?
You see I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me
See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make it
Through the day, ain't that a shame?
But maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All my love was all it took (the boy is mine)
You need to give it up
Had about enough (enough)
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine (boy is mine)
I'm sorry that you (sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (confused, ohh)
He belongs to me
The boy is mine
Must you do the things you do?
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me not you
And if you didn't know it, girl it's true
I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside
You can say what you wanna say
What we have you can't take
From the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake
When will you get the picture
You're the past, I'm the future
Get away, it's my time to shine
If you didn't know, the boy is mine, ohh
You need to give it up
Had about enough (enough)
It's not hard to see (to see)
The boy is mine (the boy is mine)
I'm sorry that you (sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (he belongs to me)
The boy is mine (the boy is mine)
You need to give it up (ooh)
Had about enough (had about enough)
It's not hard to see (he's mine, he's mine, he's mine, he's mine)
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you (I'm so sorry you seem to be confused)
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me (he belongs to me)
The boy is mine.

What'll you do when you get lonely
And nobody's waiting by your side?
You've been running and hiding much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride
Layla, you've got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling please
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind?
I tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
Turned my whole world upside down
Layla, you've got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling please
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind?
Let's make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please don't say I'll never find a way
And tell me all my love's in vain
Layla, you've got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling please
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind?
Layla (Layla) you've got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling please
Layla (oh), darling won't you ease my worried mind?.
