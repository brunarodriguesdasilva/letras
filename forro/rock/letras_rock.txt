The light in the window is a crack in the sky
A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye
A levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back
The man in the dark will bring another attack
Your momma told you that you're not supposed to talk to strangers
Look in the mirror, tell me, do you think you life's in danger, yeah?
No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)
(Tears, tears...)
Another day passes as the night closes in
The red light goes on to say it's time to begin
I see the man around the corner waiting, can he see me?
I close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here
No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)
It's just a sign of the times
Going forward in reverse
Still, he who laughs last
Is just a hand in the bush
So now that it's over, can we just say goodbye? (I'd like, I'd like)
I'd like to move on and make the most of the night
Maybe a kiss before I leave you this way
Your lips are so cold, I don't know what else to say
I never wanted it to end this way, my love, my darling
Believe me when I say to you in love, I think I'm falling here
No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)
Is just a hand in the bush
(In the bush, in the bush, in the bush...)

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside
If the pain goes on
I have screamed until my veins collapsed
I've waited as my time's elapsed
Now, all I do is live with so much hate
I've wished for this, I've bitched at that
I've left behind this little fact
You cannot kill what you did not create
I've gotta say what I've gotta say
And then, I swear, I'll go away
But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
I guess I'll save the best for last
My future seems like one big past
You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice
I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
If the pain goes on
I'm not gonna make it
Put me back together
Or separate the skin from bone
Leave me all the pieces
Then you can leave me alone
Tell me the reality is better than the dream
But I found out the hard way
Nothing is what it seems
I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane.

This town don't feel mine
I'm fast to get away, far
I dressed you in her clothes
Now drive me far away, away, away
It feels good to know you're mine
Now drive me far away, away, away
Far away I don't care where
Just far away I don't care where
Just far away I don't care where, just far away
And I don't care
Far away and I don't care where
Just far away and I don't care where
Just far away and I don't care where
Just far away I don't care
Far away and I don't care where
Just far away and I don't care where
Just far away I don't care
Just far away
Just far away, I don't care where
Just far away and I don't care where
Just far away and I don't care where
Just far away, away
Said, far away I don't care where, far away
I don't care just where, just far away
I don't care just where, far away
